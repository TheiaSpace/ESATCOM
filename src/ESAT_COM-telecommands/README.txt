COM telecommand handlers provide telecommand responses.  Each
telecommand handler implements the ESAT_CCSDSPacketConsumer interface
from ESATUtil and responds to one or several telecommands.  They are
used by ESAT_COM.


# ESAT_COMEnableTelemetryTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_ENABLE_TELEMETRY (0x00): enable the
generation of a COM telemetry packet.


#ESAT_COMDisableTelemetryTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_DISABLE_TELEMETRY (0x01): disable the
generation of a COM telemetry packet.


# ESAT_COMTransmitterEnableTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_TRANSMITTER_ENABLE (0x02): turn on the transmission
transceiver and start the transmission.


# ESAT_COMTransmitterDisableTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_TRANSMITTER_DISABLE (0x03): turn off the transmission
transceiver and disable the transmission.


# ESAT_COMReceiverEnableTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_RECEIVER_ENABLE (0x04): turn on the reception
transceiver and start the reception.


# ESAT_COMReceiverDisableTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_RECEIVER_DISABLE (0x05): turn off the reception
transceiver and disable the reception.
