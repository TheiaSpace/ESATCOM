COM telecommand handlers provide telecommand responses.  Each
telecommand handler implements the ESAT_CCSDSPacketConsumer interface
from ESATUtil and responds to one or several telecommands.  They are
used by ESAT_COM.


# ESAT_COMEnableTelemetryTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_ENABLE_TELEMETRY (0x00): enable the
generation of a COM telemetry packet.


#ESAT_COMDisableTelemetryTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_DISABLE_TELEMETRY (0x01): disable the
generation of a COM telemetry packet.


# ESAT_COMEnableTransmitterTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_ENABLE_TRANSMITTER (0x02): turn on the transmission
transceiver and start the transmission.


# ESAT_COMDisableTransmitterTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_DISABLE_TRANSMITTER (0x03): turn off the transmission
transceiver and disable the transmission.


# ESAT_COMEnableReceiverTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_ENABLE_RECEIVER (0x04): turn on the reception
transceiver and start the reception.


# ESAT_COMDisableReceiverTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_DISABLE_RECEIVER (0x05): turn off the reception
transceiver and disable the reception.


# ESAT_COMSetTimeTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_SET_TIME (0x06): set the time of the real-time clock
of the ESAT COM board.


# ESAT_COMEnableStandaloneModeTelecommand

Telecommand handler for COM_ENABLE_STANDALONE_MODE (0x07): enable the
COM telecommands self handling without OBC.
